# Implementation-of-neural-network-on-MNIST-data

Dataset: ex3data1.mat- We use a dataset which is a part of MNIST datset. This contains 5000 handwritten instances. Each of these is a
grayscale 20*20 image. The labels contains 10 classes each of which represents digit from 0 to 9.

Files:

Neural_network_our_implementation.ipynb : We have used jupyter notebook to construct the neural network. This file contains all the
necessary explanation and justifications. All the results and computations are displayed and can be easily understood. This is our 
implementation of Neural Networks on the subset of MNIST dataset. We obtained accuracy of
